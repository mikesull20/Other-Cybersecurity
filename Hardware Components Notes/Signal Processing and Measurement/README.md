## Signal Analysis

Analog vs Digital

Analog Signals vary over time, audio signals for example

Digital Signals are typically binary numbers, for example data from a digital sensor

Filtering

Low-Pass Filter: Allows low frequency signals to pass, while removing high, removes noise

High-Pass Filter: Allows high frequency signals to pass, while removing low, emphasizes edges in image processing

Digital Signal Processor (DSP): A microprocessor designer for high-speed signal processing tasks. DSPs are optimized for arithmetic operations.

## Image Analysis

Image Filtering: Using Gaussian Blur (to smooth an image) and Edge Detection (highlights the changes)

Image Enhancement: Using Histogram Equalization to enhance the contrast of an image by redistributing pixel intensity levels.

Fourier Transform: Converts an image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, useful for finding patterns.

Image Signal Processor (ISP): A specialized processor designed to handle image processing tasks. Found on cameras and smartphones

## Board and Component Level Signal Analysis

Humidity Sensor is an example

Board-Level: Measuring signals and performance at the level of the circuit board.

Component-Level: Measuring performance of a signal resistor, capacitor, transistor, or integrated circuit.

## Mixed-Domain Oscilloscopes

A tool used to capture and analyze both analog and digital signals. 

Analog Signal Capture : Measures continuous waveforms to analyze analog signals

Digital Signal Capture : Measures discrete signals to analyze digital communications
