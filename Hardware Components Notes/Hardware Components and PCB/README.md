## PCB Components

Resistor: Limit flow and divide voltages

Capacitor: Store and release electrical energy

Inductor: Stores energy in magnetic field, filters signals, manages currents

Diodes: Allow current to flow only in one direction, signal protection

Transistors: Acts as switches or amplifying for electrical signal

Integrated Circuits: Multiple electronics into one single package

Connectors: Provide interfaces for connecting different parts of an electronic 

Oscillators: Genereate precise timing signals for synchronization

Switches: Control flow of current in a circuit

Sensors: Detect physical parameters (light, pressure, humidity)

## Packaging

Surface-Mount Device (SMD) : Components are directly mounted onto the surface of the PCB, compact design

Through-Hole: Components have leads that pass through holes in the PCB and are soldered, better strength

Ball Grid Array (BGA) : IC Package with an array of solder balls on the underside for mounting onto PCB

Chip on Board (COB): SemiConductor chip attached to PCB and encapsulated, good thermals, compact design

## Board-Level Integration

Printed Circuit Board (PCB) : A board used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components

PCB Design Process
	1. Schematic : Create electrical schematics representing circuit
	2. Layout Design : Translate schematic to physical
	3. Fabrication : Manufacture the board
	4. Assembly : Place and solder

Install Heat Sinks

Power Distribution

## Circuit Notes

Ohm's Law: V = I * R

Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL) - Sum of voltages in a closed loop must be 0

Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL) - Sum of all currents entering a node equals sum of current leaving node
