## Architecture and Components:

RF Front-End: Includes antennas, filters, and amplifiers that capture and process radio signals before they are converted to digital form.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC): Converts the analog radio signals into digital signals for processing.

Digital Signal Processing (DSP): The core of SDR where various signal processing tasks (like modulation, demodulation, filtering) are performed in software.

Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC): Converts digital signals back into analog form for transmission.

Software: Implements communication protocols, signal processing algorithms, and user interfaces. It can be updated to support new features or standards.

## Advantages and Uses

Easily reconfigurable
Cost Effective
Upgradable

Tools: GNU Radio, USRP, HackRF


## Wireless Communications

1. Frequency Spectrum: Divided into bands for different types of communication

2. Modulation: 
	Amplitude Modulation (AM): Varies the amplitude of the carrier signal to encode information.

	Frequency Modulation (FM): Varies the frequency of the carrier signal.

	Phase Modulation (PM): Varies the phase of the carrier signal.

	Digital Modulation: Includes techniques like Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Phase Shift Keying (PSK) used in modern communication systems.
