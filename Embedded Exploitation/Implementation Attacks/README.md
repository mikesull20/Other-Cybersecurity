## Introduction

This writeup is for my own personal learning process, creating notes, providing examples and concepts for implementation attacks related to cryptographic algorithms. Implementation attacks are attacks that instead of trying to attack the cryptographic properties, they instead attack the implementation of the cryptographic algorithm in hardware. 

Potential Targets of Implementation Attacks: Smartcards, Personal Devices, Cell Phones, Embedded Systems

## Side-Channel 

A side channel is a pathway that information is provided from the hardware that gives insight into the cryptographic process.

For Example, with a Timing Attack, you can use the computation time to reveal information about the internal keys. This attack works on implementations that do not run in fixed time. You can input test inputs such as 1s or 0s, as since a 0 input would provide a quick computation, and a 1 input would provide a slow computation, you can start to figure out what the first bit of the key would be.

An attacker could then slowly test different combinations of 0 and 1 and compare computation times to expected computation. Even if an attacker could not determine the full key, knowing a few bits would allow them to reduce the search space for potential keys.

Another type of Side Channel Attack is a Power Analysis attack. In a simple Power Analysis attack, an attacker can observe the trace of power consumption over time and tries to apply it to the underlying cryptographic process. 

Graphing the consumption for the device will show when cryptographic processes are being used, and identical computations would have a similar consumption graph. 

In a Differential Power Analysis attack, an attacker would need to isolate a lone signal of interest from a complex power signal. From a large amount of power traces an attacker would use a hypothesis to test against all the different traces. Measuring the power consumption would clearly show when you hit a correct key.

## Fault Injection

Fault: Unexpected condition or defect within the processing

Examples: 

Power Supply Attack: Providing not enough power will give faulty calculations or giving power to parts that 

Clock/Timing Attack: 

Temperature Attacks: Increasing temperature of the hardware can cause electrons to jump over the insulation, and flip it logically. An attacker could bypass a temperature sensor and increase the temperature.

A commonly exploited algorithm is the RSA implementation using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. %n = p*q 

## Electro Magnetic Analysis

EM Attacks are focused on measuring the electromagnetic signals due to currents flowing in microelectronics. It is very similar to PA attacks as you are once again looking for fluctuations in the electromagnetic signal. This attack is important because it can be done remotely, but is challenging due to other electromagnetic noise.
