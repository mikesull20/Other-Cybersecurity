## Fuzzing

Fuzzing is an automated testing technique that could be used to discover vulnerabilities within a program. It 'overloads' the program by trying many different options repeatedly which could cause abnormal behavior.

Fuzzing generates a wide range of input, that is then fed into the program. The program executes with all the inputs, and the program is monitored for any abnormal behavior.

Tools: AFL, LibFuzzer

## Symbolic Execution

Symbolic Execution is the binary analysis technique where a program is executed with symbolic values instead of an known input. This allows for the exploration of multiple paths as you are solving the program.

It explores multiple paths systematically which can uncover bugs or vulnerabilities that are not easily found in traditional testing. This process can be easily automated.

Tools like angr in python are used to create scripts for path exploration, KLEE is another one.
