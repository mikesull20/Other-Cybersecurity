## Return-Oriented Programming (ROP):

An exploitation technique that leverages existing code snippets, known as "gadgets," that are already present in the executable or linked libraries. This requires the attacker to input 'padding + pop_eax_ret + win_func + ret', which overflow the input into the stack where the return address is stored. This would result in the program returning and running the function we want to instead of the one it should.

## Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP):

An similar exploitation technique that leverages gadgets and padding to craft an input that will execute code non intended by the program. 

## Format String Vulnerabilities: 

When user input is improperly used as format string, see the vulnerable program for an example. User can input %x or %n to cause memory issues.

## Use-After-Free (UAF):

When memory space is freed within a program, and then subsequently used, this results in a User After Free error where the you may unintentionally overwrite or attempt to access freed memory. This could result in unexpected results.

## Function Pointer Overwrites

Function pointers are used to store the address of a function, an attacker can overwrite that memory location where the function pointer is stored and redirect execution to arbitrary code.

## Counter Measures

Control Flow Integrity (CFI) - CFI Ensures that program execution follows a legitimate control flow path or that returns are made to legitimate locations

Control Flow Guard (CFG) - Validates indirect calls and jumps 

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) - Randomizes base address of key regions or at runtime.

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) - Marks memory region as non-executable
